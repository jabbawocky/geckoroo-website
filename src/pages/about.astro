        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
          Started in a shed in regional Queensland, GeckoRoo is where we share gear that actually works. No fancy offices, no PR teams – just a couple of mates who got tired of buying stuff that breaks after two uses.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
          We test everything ourselves. If it survives a weekend camping trip in the bush, a month in the workshop, or daily abuse in the kitchen, it might make the cut. If it doesn't, it goes in the bin – where most of the "revolutionary" products end up anyway.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Why "GeckoRoo"?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
          Because we're Aussie and couldn't resist. Plus, geckos stick to stuff that works, and kangaroos are tough as nails. Seemed fitting for gear that needs to stick around and take a beating.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The Affiliate Thing</h2>
        <div class="bg-gecko-50 dark:bg-gecko-900/20 rounded-lg p-6">
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            <strong>Full Transparency:</strong> Yeah, we use affiliate links. When you buy through our links, we get a small commission. It helps keep the lights on and lets us buy more gear to test.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            But here's the deal: We only recommend stuff we'd buy with our own money (and often have). No amount of commission is worth losing your trust. If something's crap, we'll tell you to save your cash.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            We're registered with ASIC (ABN: 11 642 784 263) and follow all Australian consumer law requirements. Every affiliate link is clearly marked, and we never hide the fact that we might earn from your purchase.

        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          <li>❌ Fake reviews or paid positive coverage</li>
          <li>❌ Recommend products we haven't personally tested</li>
          <li>❌ Hide affiliate relationships</li>
          <li>❌ Pretend budget gear is premium (or vice versa)</li>
          <li>❌ Take ourselves too seriously</li>

          Got a product you reckon we should test? Found something that's actually brilliant? Or just want to tell us we're wrong about something? We're all ears.
