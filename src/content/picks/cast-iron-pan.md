# Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Pan Review

Three months of daily use, from camping trips to kitchen duty. This affordable cast iron pan has become our go-to for everything from steaks to cornbread.

## The Seasoning

Unlike some "pre-seasoned" pans that arrive looking like they've been sprayed with cooking oil, this one came with a proper base layer. First cook was bacon (as tradition demands), and nothing stuck.

## Versatility

We've used this on gas stovetops, induction cookers, campfires, and in the oven. The heat retention is brilliant for searing steaks, and the oven-safe design means one-pan dinners are a breeze.

## Maintenance Reality

Yes, cast iron needs care, but it's not rocket science. Quick scrub with hot water, dry thoroughly, light oil coat. Five minutes max. The seasoning has only improved with use.
