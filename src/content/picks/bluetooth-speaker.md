# Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker Review

Four months, two pool parties, and one beach camping trip later, this speaker is still going strong. Here's what survived our "testing."

## Water Resistance

The IPX7 rating isn't just marketing fluff. This thing spent 10 minutes at the bottom of the pool (don't ask) and kept playing when we fished it out. No distortion, no issues.

## Battery Life

The 20-hour claim is accurate at moderate volumes. Crank it to max for a party and you'll get about 12 hours, which is still impressive for the size and price.

## Sound Quality

Clear mids and highs, decent bass for the size. It won't replace a proper sound system, but for poolside, camping, or workshop tunes, it's more than adequate. The stereo pairing feature is a nice bonus.
