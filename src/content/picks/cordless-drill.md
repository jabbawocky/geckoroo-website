# 18V Cordless Drill Review

Six months ago, we picked this up to replace our ancient corded drill. After building a deck, installing shelving, and countless shed projects, here's the verdict.

## Performance

The 18V battery delivers consistent power even when drilling into hardwood. We've put over 200 3-inch screws into treated pine without a single battery swap. The variable speed trigger gives good control for delicate work.

## Build Quality

Solid construction where it matters. The chuck grips properly (no more stripped screw heads), and the motor hasn't shown any signs of struggling. The plastic case is the weak point - those hinges will probably go first.

## Value Proposition

At this price point, it punches well above its weight. You're not getting DeWalt quality, but you're also not paying DeWalt prices. Perfect for weekend warriors and light trade use.
