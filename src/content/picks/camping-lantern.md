# Rechargeable Camping Lantern Review

After three camping trips and one "accidental" drop from the ute tray, this budget lantern is still going strong. Here's what we found after a month of real-world testing.

## The Good Stuff

The battery life claims actually hold up. We got a solid 7 hours on medium brightness during our Fraser Island trip, which was more than enough for dinner prep and late-night yarns around the camp.

USB-C charging is a game-changer. No more proprietary cables to lose in the bottom of your camping gear. Charges from dead to full in about 3 hours off a standard power bank.

## Room for Improvement

The handle attachment point could be beefier. It hasn't broken, but it flexes more than we'd like when hanging from a branch. We've started using a carabiner through the base mount instead.

## Bottom Line

For under $30, this is solid value. It won't replace a high-end lantern, but for weekend warriors and backup lighting, it's spot on.
