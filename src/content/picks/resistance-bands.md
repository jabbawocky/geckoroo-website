# Resistance Band Set Review

When gyms shut down, we grabbed these bands. Two years later, they're still part of our routine. Here's why they stuck around.

## What's in the Box

Five bands (10-50lbs resistance), door anchor, ankle straps, handles, and a carry bag. Everything you need for a full-body workout, and it all fits in a bag smaller than a six-pack.

## Build Quality

The latex is thick and consistent - no thin spots or bubbles. Carabiners are solid metal, not plastic. After hundreds of workouts, no signs of wear or tearing. The door anchor is the real MVP - grips tight without damaging door frames.

## Workout Effectiveness

Skeptical at first, but these deliver a proper workout. The resistance is smooth throughout the range of motion. Combining bands lets you go heavy for legs and back. Perfect for travel or home workouts.
