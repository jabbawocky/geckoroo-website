# Retractable Garden Hose Reel Review

After dealing with tangled hoses for years, we finally grabbed one of these retractable units. Six months of daily watering and car washing later, here's the truth.

## Installation & Setup

Wall mounting took 20 minutes with the included hardware. The 180-degree swivel is brilliant - covers the entire yard from one spot. Just make sure you hit studs or use proper wall anchors.

## Daily Use

The auto-retract mechanism is smooth and controlled - no violent snap-back like cheaper models. The lock clicks in at any length, stays put, and releases with a gentle tug.

## Durability

Australian sun hasn't faded or cracked the housing yet. The hose itself is decent quality - hasn't kinked permanently despite some rough handling. Time will tell on the retract spring, but so far, so good.
